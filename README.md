## 🧠 About the Project

**TaskFlow** was developed as part of my internship at **Lenok Solutions**, an aviation-focused IT company specializing in custom software development.  
The project’s goal was to create a **scalable task management web app** where managers can assign and monitor tasks, while employees can view and update their own.

It emphasizes:
- Role-specific dashboards (Manager / Employee)
- Modern UI design with responsive layouts
- Smooth user experience powered by React SPA architecture
